# Leaf-Disease-Classification-System
A deep learning-based system for classifying leaves as healthy or diseased using convolutional neural networks (CNN)using python

## Features
Binary classification (healthy/diseased)
Handles various leaf types
64x64 RGB image processing
Real-time prediction capability
~90% accuracy on test data

## Requirement imported:
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib

## Limitations

Only binary classification (healthy/diseased)

Works best with clear leaf images on plain backgrounds

Minimum recommended image size: 256x256 pixels
